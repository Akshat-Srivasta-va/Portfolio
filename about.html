            <p class="paragraph">"Hello! My name is Akshat Srivastava, and I am currently a CSE.
                I am passionate about learning and exploring new ideas. My passion for technology drives me to continuously explore new areas, 
                learn new skills, and embrace the challenges that come with this exciting field.As a student of Computer Science, I am particularly interested in areas 
                such as programming, artificial intelligence, and data analysis. Through my academic journey, I have developed a strong foundation in coding,
                 problem-solving, and critical thinking, which I aim to further enhance in the coming years.</p>
